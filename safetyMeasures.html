                      <h3>How do you get the virus?</h3>
                      <p>The virus enters your body through your eyes, nose, and mouth. 
                          In your body, it makes a lot of copies of itself. When there are too many copies of the virus, you get sick.</p>

                      <h3>Why shouldn't I touch my face?</h3>
                      <p>You might have the virus on your hands after being in a public space and touching door handles and other things.
                          If you touch your face, the virus would be able to enter your body and make you sick.
                      </p>

                      <h3>How do I stop touching my face?</h3>
                      <p>Here are some tips:
                      </p>
                      <p>- Wash your hands often: it's safe to touch your face if your hands are clean
                      </p>
                      <p>- Be aware of your emotions: people tend to touch their face less when they're relaxed
                    </p>
                    <p>- Keep your hands busy: try doing a puzzle, getting a stress ball, or another <a href="creative.html">fun activity</a>
                    </p>

                            <h3>Why should I wear a mask?</h3>
                            <p>When a person talks, coughs, or sneezes, they release droplets that can carry the virus and make you sick. 
                                Masks protect you by blocking these droplets.</p>

                            <h3>It's safest if everyone wears a mask.</h3>
                            <p>By wearing a mask, you're not only protecting yourself but also others around you. This is very important 
                                for stopping the spread of Covid-19.
                            </p>

                            <p> Ask your parents to help you adjust your mask. Many stores sell kids' masks, so 
                                your parents can also visit their websites to find the right sized mask for you.

                       <P>Social distancing means staying home, staying away from large groups of people, and staying 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people.</P>

                       <h3>Why should we social distance?</h3>
                       <P>It's harder for the virus to spread when people stay far away from each other and interact less.</P>
