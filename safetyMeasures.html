                      <p class="t1">The virus enters your body through your eyes, nose, and mouth. 
                          Once it's in your body, it makes a lot of copies of itself. When there are too many copies of the virus, you get sick.</p>

                      <h3 class="typ2">Why shouldn't I touch my face?</h3>
                      <p class="t1">You might have the virus on your hands after being in a public space and touching door handles and other things.
                          If you touch your face, the virus would be able to enter your body and make you sick.

                      </p>
                      <p class="t1">- Wash your hands often: it's safe to touch your face if your hands are clean
                      </p>
                      <p class="t1">- Be aware of your emotions: people tend to touch their face less when they're relaxed
                    </p>
                    <p class="t1">- Keep your hands busy: try doing a puzzle, getting a stress ball, or another <a href="creative.html" target="_blank">fun activity</a>
                    </p>

                            <h3 class="typ3">Why should I wear a mask?</h3>
                            <p class="t2">When a person talks, coughs, or sneezes, they release droplets that can carry the virus and make you sick. 
                                Masks protect you by blocking these droplets.</p>

                            <h3 class="typ3">It's safest if everyone wears a mask.</h3>
                            <p class="t2">By wearing a mask, you're not only protecting yourself but also others around you. This is very important 
                                for stopping the spread of Covid-19.
