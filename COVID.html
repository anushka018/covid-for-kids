            What can happen if you get sick? COVID-19 doesn’t look the same for everyone. When some people are sick, they can have a cough, it’s hard for them to breathe or they have a fever
        </li>
        <div>
        <li>
            Being sick doesnt mean you have COVID-19. People can get sick from different kinds of germs. But it’s important to ask for help when you are sick or have symptoms. A symptom shows that you are sick with something.
