Our Hack for the People Hackathon project is creating a kid-friendly learning site on covid 19. It is specifically designed for children ages 5-10 to understand the coronvirus and have a basic understanding of what’s going on. This will help them know how to stay safe as covid cases continue to increase in the US.

This is important because kids are often left out of the conversation when it comes to the pandemic. There isn’t much information catered to them at a level they can understand.

This is extremely relevant right now with kids going back to school and some even having in person classes. Having kids practice proper safety measures means it will be less likely for them to contract the virus and spread it to their family members, who may be older and more vulnerable. Understanding the pandemic would empower young students to make sure schools, local governments, and other policy-makers are acting in their best interests. How kids interpret and understand covid could influence attitudes and future protocols in global health

As valued members of society, it is important that younger chidren understand what’s going on and how to navigate the new state of the world.

Learned: We learned HTML, css, Javascript, and how to use github pages and collaborate on github. We also used many multimedia features in HTML and css.

Challenges: Challenge we faced were coordinating our website design, placing images and text on each webpage, and linking to each page correctly. We also worked on stating information in a simple, kid-friendly way and making our website engaging to kids.
